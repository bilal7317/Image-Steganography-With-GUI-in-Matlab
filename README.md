Abstractâ€”This project deals with learning about thevarious types of steganography available. Image steganographyis performed for images and the concerning 
data is alsodecrypted to retrieve the message image. Since this can be donein several ways, image steganography is studied and one of themethods is used to 
demonstrate it. Image steganography refersto hiding information i.e., text, images or audio files in anotherimage or video files. The current project aims 
to usesteganography for an image with another image using spatialdomain technique. This hidden information can be retrievedonly through proper decoding 
technique. This encryption anddecryption of the images is done using MATLAB codes
